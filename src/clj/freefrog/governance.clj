;;; Defines how governance can be manipulated, and is intended
;;; to comply to the
;;; [Holacracy Constitution v4.0](http://bit.ly/holacracy-constitution-v4)
;;;
;;; Designed to provide all manipulation functions for Holacracy governance
;;; structures. It is not recommended that the structures
;;; generated/manipulated by this namespace be manually edited outside of
;;; this namespace for any purpose.
;;;
;;; This would cause difficulties tracking down the source of a structure
;;; should one need to do so. It also adds the benefit of having all logic in
;;; one place so one can more easily reason about it.
